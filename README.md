# SHANI
Simple Heurestic n a Interpreter (name description not ready yet).
This is simple pseudo intelligent assistant.

It have module based structure so it's quite simple to add new features.
Queries parsing is done by keyword search.

Curretly there is no dedicated console. Run it with cmd(java -jar Shani.jar) or provided .bat file.

For now it support only Polish language. I have to add data files with translations.

Current modules:
Execute(open file/application, exec batch script, or local url based actions(eg. steam://rungameid/335300)),
Timer,
Dictionary(Polish, English German. Taken from translatica.pl webside),
Calculator,
Weather forecast printer(forecast from Weather.com),
execution of cmd commands inside shani consoles.
